# Rectessellate
- [ ] Allow the user to work entirely in cells / pixels if they'd like — converting to internally stored percentage constraints.
- [ ] Include resizing capability — snapping to neighboring pane sizes if the resize would naturally pass that snapping point
- [ ] Work with integer constraints — cells, pixels, whatever — no floating-point or rounding nonsense exposed to the user!
- [ ] Allow tiles to have minimum and maximum sizes, in addition to their preferred percentage size
